GScript
=======

Converts your Groovy code to JavaScript(Groovy 2.0 to Javascript ECMAScript 5) <br/>
Get AST -> To nice JavaScript, some common functions in other js files.<br/>

Missing some groovy stuff:<br/>
Inheritance stuff as super.<br/>
Not class, instanceof,...<br/>
In classes, not allowed same number of parameters in methods / constructors.<br/>
Can add methods and properties with metaclass, but some problems with primitive types as String and Number<br/>
Losing pretty print, had to function == (equals), and I suppose same for other operators.<br/>
